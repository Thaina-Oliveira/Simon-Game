- The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order.
- After successfully repeating the sequence, the game adds another randomly chosen color to the sequence, making it longer.
- The sequence continues to grow longer with each successful repetition.
- If the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing the buttons out of sequence, the game ends.
